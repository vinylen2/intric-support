## Who we are  
Intric is a secure, scalable AI-platform built for European enterprises and public sector organisations. No prior technical expertise required — we empower teams across the organisation to create, launch and use powerful AI tools, backed by robust governance and full data control. [intric.ai](https://www.intric.ai)

## What we do  
- **Build intelligent assistants without code.** Create AI workflows that pull in knowledge, connect tools and automate complex tasks from a simple chat interface.  
- **Enterprise-ready and compliant.** Hosted within the EU (and Sweden) or on-premises if required. Fully aligned with GDPR and other European data-protection laws.  
- **Open and flexible.** Choose any large language model or modality (text, audio, images), integrate custom data sources and build the platform your organisation needs — not a one-size-fits-all product.

## Our mission  
To make AI accessible, secure and controllable — so organisations can focus on impact instead of complexity. By combining simplicity, sovereignty and scale we believe AI should work *for* you, not the other way around.
