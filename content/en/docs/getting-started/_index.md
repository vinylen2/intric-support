## Core Concepts

### 🧠 Assistants

AI-powered tools that can be customised for specific tasks, such as writing, research, data analysis, or customer support.\
Assistants can be built by anyone with the right permissions and shared across teams.

### 🗂️ Spaces

Collaboration areas where teams can organise their assistants and resources.\
Each space can contain multiple assistants and its own knowledge base, making it easy to separate projects, departments, or customers.

### 📚 Knowledge

Documents, notes, and other materials that assistants use as context when answering questions or performing tasks.\
Knowledge can be uploaded or connected from external sources, ensuring responses are based on your organisation’s own information.

### 💬 Personal Assistant

The always-available chat at the top of the interface.\
Every user has access to their own personal assistant for quick questions, brainstorming, or exploring what the platform can do.
