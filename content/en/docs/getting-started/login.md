### How to Log In
Login to Intric is handled via your organisation’s **SSO system (Single Sign-On)** — typically integrated with **Microsoft Entra ID** or **Active Directory**.  
Many organisations also have **MFA (multi-factor authentication)** enabled for additional security.  
Use the **same credentials** you use for your other organisational systems.
