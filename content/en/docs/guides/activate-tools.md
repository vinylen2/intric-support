### Step 1: Check Model Compatibility
- Ensure your chosen model supports tools.
- Models like **GPT-4**, **Claude**, and **Mistral** generally support tools.
- Many open-source models (e.g., some **Llama** variants) may not support tool use.

### Step 2: Enable Tools on the Assistant
1. Open the assistant → **Edit**.
2. Scroll to **Additional Capabilities**.
3. Toggle desired tools, e.g.:
   - **Image Generation:** Create images from descriptions.
   - **Web Search:** Fetch up-to-date information from the internet.
   - **SCB:** Query Statistics Sweden (SCB) data.
   - **Kolada:** Query Kolada’s municipal indicators.

### Step 3: Test Functionality
- Try each enabled tool with a small task.
- Note that tools may affect response time and cost.
