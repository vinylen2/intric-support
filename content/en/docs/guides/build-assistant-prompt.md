### Step 1: Create an Assistant
1. Go to **Assistants** (left menu).
2. Click **Create Assistant** (blue button, top-right).
3. Choose a template or **Build from scratch**.

### Step 2: Configure Basics
1. Name the assistant.
2. Choose a language model (based on use case & security classification).
3. Click **Create**.

### Step 3: Write an Effective Prompt
Use this structure:

- **What?** Clearly describe the task and scope.  
- **Who?** Define the assistant’s role (e.g., “You are an HR specialist…”).  
- **How?** Specify output format and structure.  
- **Why?** Provide background/context and the objective.  
- **Tone?** Set the style (formal, friendly, technical, etc.).

**Example prompt**

> You are an HR specialist who helps employees with HR-related questions.  
> Always respond professionally and reference our policy documents when relevant.  
> Structure answers with clear headings and bullet points.  
> If you don’t know, ask the user to contact the HR department.

### Step 4: Test & Iterate
- Ask diverse questions.
- Go back to **Edit** and refine the prompt.
- Repeat until responses meet expectations.
