### AI Assistants
Assistants are the main feature of the Intric platform — customizable AI tools with a chat interface that allow users to:

- Ask questions and receive answers based on the organisation’s own data  
- Adapt assistants for specific use cases (e.g. Legal, HR, Communications)  
- Integrate with internal knowledge sources through **RAG technology (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  

#### Components that define an assistant:
- **Language Model:** Choose between different AI models (Swedish/EU-based or U.S.-based)  
- **Prompt:** The set of instructions that defines how the assistant should behave  
- **Knowledge:** The data and information the assistant uses to generate responses

### Apps
Specialised tools for clearly defined tasks, such as:

- Primarily used for **transcribing meetings and audio files**  
- Designed for structured input and output  
- Use the same components as assistants but are optimised for specific processes

### Knowledge Management
The **Knowledge** section allows you to integrate your organisation’s data sources:

- **Collections:** Upload documents, spreadsheets, and presentations  
- **Web Pages:** Connect and automatically crawl websites for relevant content  
- **Integrations:** Direct connections to **SharePoint**, **Confluence**, and other systems  
- **RAG Technology:** The system performs semantic searches across all connected data to find the most relevant information

### Collaboration Features

#### Spaces (Workspaces)
Spaces are collaborative environments where teams can work together around assistants and shared data.

- Role-based access control (**Space Admin**, **Space Editor**, **Space Viewer**)  
- Can be organised by team, project, or function  
- Each Space can have its own assistants, knowledge, and permissions  

#### Sharing and Templates
- Share assistants across different organisations  
- Use ready-made templates for common use cases in the public sector  
- Build and publish your own templates for recurring tasks
