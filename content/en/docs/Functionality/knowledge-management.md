The **Knowledge** section lets you integrate, structure, and maintain the data that powers your assistants.

### Ways to Add Knowledge
- **Collections:** Upload and organise documents, spreadsheets, and presentations  
- **Web Pages:** Connect websites and automatically crawl their content  
- **Integrations:** Connect directly to systems like **SharePoint**, **Confluence**, and more  

### How It Works
Intric uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** â€” meaning the system searches semantically across all connected sources to find relevant information before generating a response.  
This ensures answers are accurate, contextual, and based on your own trusted data.
