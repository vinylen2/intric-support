AI Assistants are the core of Intric — customizable AI tools with a chat interface that allow users to interact with organisational knowledge and workflows.

### What You Can Do
- Ask questions and get accurate answers based on your organisation’s own data  
- Customise assistants for specific use cases such as **legal**, **HR**, or **communications**  
- Integrate internal knowledge sources via **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** technology  

### Components That Define an Assistant
- **Language Model:** Choose from multiple AI models — EU-based, Swedish, or U.S.-based  
- **Prompt:** The instruction set that defines how the assistant behaves  
- **Knowledge:** The content and data sources the assistant uses to respond
