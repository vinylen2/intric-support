Intric is designed for teamwork â€” enabling secure, role-based collaboration through **Spaces** and shared templates.

### Spaces (Workspaces)
- Collaborative environments for teams to manage assistants and knowledge  
- Role-based access: **Space Admin**, **Space Editor**, **Space Viewer**  
- Organise by team, project, or function  

### Sharing and Templates
- Share assistants across different departments or organisations  
- Use pre-built templates for common public sector and enterprise use cases  
- Create your own templates to standardise best practices
