## Security and Model Management

### Security Classification
Admins can define **security classification levels** (for example: *High Security Classification*) to manage data exposure and model usage.

- Each classification maps to specific AI models allowed for that level.  
- **Space Admins** then select a classification level rather than choosing models directly.  
- Ensures model usage stays compliant with organisational and regulatory policies.

### Model Control
Admins can configure which **AI models** are active and available across the organisation.

- Enables fine-grained control over which models can process data.  
- Helps enforce **data residency** and **regulatory compliance** (EU vs. U.S. models).  
- Managed via **Admin → Models** in the interface.

### Personal Assistant Configuration
Under **Admin → Personal Assistant**, you can:
- Choose which language models are available for the personal assistant.  
- Control which tools and extensions are enabled by default.
